I would like to keep up with Generative AI news. It's hard to do though because there are so many launches nowadays. Please help me research all of the launches that came out in the last week. For reference, today is {DATE}. Focus on the aspects I'm most interested in:

* Frontier models - any frontier model like Gemini, Llama, etc that have come out this week and have either beat the existing best frontier models, or benchmark around the best in the world right now and are very small, like Gemma3 27B did recently. Include what things reviews are pointing out of qualities that the new model is better than the current best frontier models.
* AI coding tools - any new AI coding tools. Please explain what they do, how they increase productivity in coding projects.
* AI image generations - any new image generation models that either create much better pictures than the best options, lower cost and comparable performance than the market leaders, or open models that can be run on consumer hardware.
* AI agents - any new AI agents that have demonstrated an ability that it can perform with reliability. Please include reviews about the quality of the agents and what makes it good and what to watch out for.
* AI tools - any other AI tools that are making waves in the AI community and in news reports. Please only include ones that are much better than the best competitors or a unique application of AI.

Add a TLDR at the very top to highlight the most exciting advancedments in the past week. Only include only launches that are actually known and public, not speculated launches. Do not include irrelevant information.

Make the report have a blogpost style. Keep the information clear and concise. Make tables where it makes sense.

I would like to be able to read this very quickly and understand the overview of the activity in the past week with the ability to investigate further on the pieces that interest me. I do not want to waste time on speculated announcements, not actual launches.
